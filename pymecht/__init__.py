'''
pyMechT is a Python package for simulating the mechanical response of soft biological tissues.

It is a collection of modules for:

    * defining material models
    * simulating experiments, such as uniaxial extension, biaxial extension, and inflation-extension
    * fitting parameters to experimental data
    * Bayesian inference by running Monte Carlo (MC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations

This package is developed and maintained by the `Computational Biomechanics Research Group <https://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/ankush.aggarwal/>`_ at the University of Glasgow.

The focus is on simplified models,rather than finite element analysis. 
Thus, varying parameters and running simulations is much faster, allowing Bayesian inference etc.
